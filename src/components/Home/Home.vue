        Unveiling the World within Us through Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)
      </p>
      <p class="my-6">
        Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an ever-advancing technology. Since
        its introduction into mainstream imaging departments in the UK in the
        late 1980s, the growth in MRI has been rapid culminating in it becoming
        the preferred imaging modality for many investigations. Advances in
        magnet design, Radio Frequency (RF) technology and the increasing
        availability of high field strength systems means that techniques such
        as cardiac, functional and interventional MRI to name a few are
        available in many imaging departments. The scope of radiographic
        practice within MRI continues to broaden, with highly specialised and
        knowledgeable radiographers providing this essential imaging service.

      <p class="text-h6 my-8 text-start">The role of the radiographer</p>
      <p class="w-full text-start pb-2">
        The increase in the scope of MRI applications means that radiographers
        have extended their roles to incorporate advanced techniques. For
        example, within the field of vascular imaging, MR Angiography (MRA)
        techniques are used for the assessment of peripheral arteries, thoracic
        vessels, coronary arteries and for pulmonary vein evaluation. Perfusion
        Cardiac MR is a technique used for perfusion and ischaemia testing, as
        well as the diagnosis of coronary heart disease, heart valve problems
        and congenital heart defects. The radiographers’ core skills enable new
        and advanced techniques to be implemented effectively and efficiently
        for improved patient outcomes.

        History of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      </p>
      <p class="w-full text-start">
        Magnets were first discovered by the Romans more than 2000 years ago.
        Over the years, the understanding of magnet has increased and many
        applications have developed. The history of NMR (known as MRI) begins
        with a french mathematician
        <em>Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier </em>(1768–1830) who developed a
        mathematical method to analyze the heat transfer between solid bodies.
        Later this discovery made rapid processing of phase and frequency
        signals possible in NMR.
        <br />
        The unit strength of a magnetic field is the Tesla (1 Tesla = 1
        Newton/Ampere-meter) and is named after Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla
        (1856–1943) who discovered the rotating magnetic field.
      </p>
      <p class="w-full text-start my-6">
        An Irish physicist, Sir Joseph Larmor (1857–1942) discovered a way to
        calculate the rate at which energy is radiated by an accelerated
        electron. He also explained the splitting of spectrum lines by a
        magnetic field. He is famous in the field of NMR for the so-called
        larmor equation, which states that the frequency of precession of the
        nuclear magnetic moment (<em>ω</em>) is directly proportional to the
        product of the magnetic field strength (B0) and the gyromagnetic ratio
        (<em>γ </em>): <em>ω </em>= <em>γ</em>B0.
      </p>
      <p class="w-full text-start my-6">
        An Austrian, Isidor Rabi (1898–1988) working in the Department of
        Physics at Columbia University in New York, discovered a way to detect
        and measure single states of rotation of atoms and molecules. He also
        succeeded in determining the magnetic moments of the nuclei. For his
        discoveries, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.
      </p>
      <p class="w-full text-start my-6">
        In 1940s, Felix Bloch working at stanford university and Edward Purcell
        from harvard university independent of each other, described a
        physicochemical phenomenon which was based on the magnetic properties of
        certain nuclei in the periodic system. They found that when certain
        nuclei were placed in a magnetic field they absorbed energy in the
        electromagnetic spectrum and re-emitted this energy when they returned
        to their original state. The strength of the magnetic field and the
        radiofrequency matched each other according to the Larmor relationship.
        For this discovery, Bloch and Purcell were awarded with the nobel prize
        for physics in 1952.
      </p>
      <p class="w-full text-start my-6">
        In 1971, Raymond Damadian from Downstate Medical Center in New York
        measured T1 and T2 relaxation times of normal and cancerous rat tissues
        and found that normal tissue had shorter relaxation times than the
        tumour tissue.
      </p>
      <p class="w-full text-start my-6">
        In 1974, Paul C. Lauterbur, a professor of chemistry and radiology at
        New York University and Peter Mansfield from the department of physics
        at the Nottingham University England independent of each other,
        described the use of magnetic field gradients for spatial localization
        of NMR signals. These discoveries led to the foundation for Magnetic
        Resonance Imaging (MRI). For this discovery, Lauterbur and Mansfield
        were awarded with the nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 2003.
      </p>
      <p class="w-full text-start my-6">
        In 1975, a Swiss physical chemist Richard Ernst described the use of
        Fourier transform of phase and frequency encoding to reconstruct 2D
        images. For this discovery he was awarded with the nobel prize for
        chemistry in 1991.
      </p>
      <p class="w-full text-start my-6">
        Later in &nbsp;1975, Peter Mansfield and Andrew Maudsley proposed a line
        scan technique, which led to the first cross sectional imaging of human
        anatomy (cross section through a finger). In 1978, Hugh Clow and Ian R.
        Young worked at a British company called EMI, created &nbsp;the first
        transverse NMR image through a human head.
